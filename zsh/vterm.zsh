# Some of the most useful features in emacs-libvterm require shell-side
# configurations. The main goal of these additional functions is to enable the
# shell to send information to `vterm` via properly escaped sequences. A
# function that helps in this task, `vterm_printf`, is defined below.

# With vterm_cmd you can execute Emacs commands directly from the shell.
# For example, vterm_cmd message "HI" will print "HI".
# To enable new commands, you have to customize Emacs's variable
# vterm-eval-cmds.
